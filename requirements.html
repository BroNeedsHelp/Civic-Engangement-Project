      <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
      <p>To qualify for STRIVE tax benefits and community incentives, you must meet a set of baseline criteria. These ensure the integrity of the system while remaining accessible to all eligible participants.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Must be a registered voter in your respective region.</li>
        <li>Minimum participation in at least one verified local, state, or federal election per year.</li>
        <li>Submission of a digital or physical proof of participation (e.g. government-issued receipt or STRIVE partner verification).</li>
        <li>Willingness to link your voter ID to your taxpayer profile (secure and encrypted, of course).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Process</h2>
      <p>We take security seriously. STRIVE verifies participation through a triple-check system to prevent fraud and maximize fairness:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Electronic matching of tax IDs and voter records (encrypted).</li>
        <li>Community polling station reports and digital check-ins.</li>
        <li>Third-party audits from certified civic technology providers.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Community-Level Metrics</h2>
      <p>For neighborhoods or groups applying for pooled benefits, these extra requirements apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum 60% turnout across all eligible residents in the district.</li>
        <li>Quarterly civic engagement workshops hosted or attended.</li>
        <li>Annual review submission to maintain access to infrastructure incentives.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Adaptations</h2>
      <p>As STRIVE scales, future requirements may include adaptive scoring for civic activities, volunteerism, and educational outreachâ€”always keeping the spirit of democracy at the core. Your participation helps shape that future.</p>
