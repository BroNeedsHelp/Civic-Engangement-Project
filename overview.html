      <h2>Individual Taxpayer Benefits</h2>
      <p>STRIVE provides targeted tax reductions for individuals who engage in verified electoral processes. These reductions are tiered based on frequency of participation, level of election (local, state, federal), and educational involvement in civic programs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 5% reduction for consistent local election participation.</li>
        <li>Bonus deductions for first-time voters.</li>
        <li>Micro-incentives for participating in verified civic engagement workshops.</li>
        <li>Optional crypto-backed tax credits (pilot regions only).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Community Impact</h2>
      <p>STRIVE scales incentives based on community participation metrics. This encourages group action and fosters stronger civic communities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neighborhood tax pooling: Collective voting activity reduces property tax burdens.</li>
        <li>School grants linked to community voting rates.</li>
        <li>Bonus infrastructure funding for high-turnout zones.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="nation">
      <h2>National Scale Advantages</h2>
      <p>As STRIVE grows, national benefits include a more engaged electorate, streamlined tax processing for voters, and strengthened democratic resilience through incentivized participation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower fraud risk via verified voter-tax integration.</li>
        <li>Stronger correlation between civic literacy and tax transparency.</li>
        <li>Improved public trust through traceable civic contributions.</li>
        <li>Enhanced voter turnout in traditionally low-participation demographics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>STRIVE in the Future</h2>
      <p>The long-term vision includes AI-enhanced civic tracking, voting experiences, and seamless tax benefit automation—all while maintaining the initiative’s foundational goal: a smarter, fairer democracy.</p>
